# scss-helpers
These files are a small set of helper functions, mixins and partials that I reuse across projects. Becasue I work on proprietary projects I chose to use the MIT License instead of the GPL in order to sidestep any headaches about needing to open code. 

## Files

### \_media.scss
A responsive media query framework

### \_partials.scss
Ready-to-use partials derived from mixins and functions in \_mixins.scss.

### \_mixins.scss
A collection of useful mixins for font size, SVG spriteshets, flexbox, flexible sizing...and more!

## License

## Credit
Some mixins were derived from examples and concepts already present on the Internet, so I cannot make any claim to being an original creator. Something something truer to say that I stand upon the shoulder of giants.
